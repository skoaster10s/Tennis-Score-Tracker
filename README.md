# OVERVIEW
This set of files is an applet that keeps track of the score of two people playing a tennis match.
There are two different versions of the application that both display the score of the tennis match.
The first one made, ScoreTrackerTesterORI, uses simple formatted text to display the score.
The second one made, ScoreTrackerTesterGUI, implements Java GUI to display the score in a much more
user-friendly and interactive window.

------------------------------------------------

# NOTES
* The ScoreTrackerTesterORI (non-GUI) version is bug-free.
* The ScoretrackerTesterGUI (GUI) version has some minor bugs that is being fixed, but is fully functional
for most score cases.
* Tested with BlueJ IDE.
